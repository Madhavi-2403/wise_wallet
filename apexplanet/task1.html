        Worrying too much about spending money can make you feel tired, sad, or guilty.<br>
        You might start to fear spending, even when itâ€™s for something important.
      </p>
      <p>
         3. Not Taking Care of Yourself<br>
         If you save too much, you might not spend enough on healthy food, school supplies, or a safe place to live.<br>
        This can hurt your health or make studying harder.
